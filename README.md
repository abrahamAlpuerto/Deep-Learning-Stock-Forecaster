# LSTM (Long-Short term Memory) Models created to predict the stock market.
One is to predict short term being less effective but another to predict 2 months into the future or 40 days. The 40 day prediction model proving solid generalization results on multiple backtesting. Different architectures were tried while the LSTM with Attention Layers proved the best results yielding < 2% MAPE which is exceptional results according to industry standards.
